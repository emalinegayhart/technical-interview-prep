# Problem Description

```
You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

# Approach

options to consider:
greedy algo - at each step, make the locally optimal choice (the farthest possible jump) with the hope of finding a global optimum
dynamic programming - break the problem down into smaller subproblems and build up a solution
backtracking- explore all possible jump sequences to see if any lead to the last index

thinking greedy algo since its just asking for true or false not the actual path

create variable for the furthest index we can reach
iterate through the nums array
if the current index is larger than furthest reachable index return false 
set the furthest reachable index to the max between the current furthest reachable index & the current index + the value of the current index (which should be the furthest reachable index)
if the furthest reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index (len(nums)-1) return true 
then when done iterating return if the furthest reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index ^^

# Code 

```
def canJump(nums):
    furthest_reachable_index = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i > furthest_reachable_index:
            return False
        furthest_reachable_index = max(furthest_reachable_index, i + nums[i])
        if furthest_reachable_index >= len(nums) - 1:
            return True
    return furthest_reachable_index >= len(nums) - 1
```
