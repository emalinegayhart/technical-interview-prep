# problem description

```
Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

Return a list of all possible strings we could create. Return the output in any order.


Example 1:
Input: s = "a1b2"
Output: ["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]

Example 2:
Input: s = "3z4"
Output: ["3z4","3Z4"]
 
```

# approach

go through each character of the string. if it’s a letter, swap between lowercase and uppercase. if it’s a digit, just keep it as it is. use backtracking to generate all combinations.

# code

```
class Solution(object):
    def letterCasePermutation(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        result = []
    
        def backtrack(index, path):
            if index == len(s):
                result.append(''.join(path))
                return
            
            if s[index].isalpha():
                backtrack(index + 1, path + [s[index].lower()])
                backtrack(index + 1, path + [s[index].upper()])
            else:
                backtrack(index + 1, path + [s[index]])
        
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result
```
