# problem description

```
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 105

```

# approach

in-order traversal of a bst gives nodes in ascending order. so just traverse the tree in-order, track the difference between the current and previous node values, and keep the smallest difference.

# code

```
class Solution(object):
    def minDiffInBST(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def inorder(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
        
        values = inorder(root)
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(1, len(values)):
            min_diff = min(min_diff, values[i] - values[i-1])
        
        return min_diff
