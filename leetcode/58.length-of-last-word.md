# Problem Description

```
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
```

# Approach
notes: "The rfind() method in Python is used to find the last occurrence of a specified substring within a string. It returns the index of the last occurrence if found, and -1 if the substring is not found."

strip the sentence & find the index of the last space (rfind)
if rfind returns -1 it means a space (substring) is not found and so the entire string is the whole word
otherwise subtract the returned value from rfind and the 1 space from the length of the string to find the length of the last word

# Code 

```
def lengthOfLastWord(sentence):
    stripped_string = sentence.rstrip()
    
    last_space_index = stripped_string.rfind(' ')

    if last_space_index == -1:
        return len(stripped_string)
    else:
        return len(stripped_string) - last_space_index - 1
```
