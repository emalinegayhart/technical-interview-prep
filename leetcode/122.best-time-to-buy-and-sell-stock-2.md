# Problem Description

```
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

```

# Approach
notes: "a greedy algorithm is a problem-solving technique that chooses the best option at each step, without regard to the overall problem"
limitations: only considers info at each step, good when needing to find max & mins

have a variable for the MAX PROFITTT
iterate through the PRICESS ARRAYY
but start on the second day (index 1)
then COMPAREEEE current to last day (so like start comparing the second day to the first)
if the current is larger than the last, add the difference to MAX PROFITTT
then return that shiiiii

# Code 

```
def maxProfit(prices):
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
            max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
    return max_profit
```
