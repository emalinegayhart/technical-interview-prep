# Problem Description

```
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
```

# Approach

three-pointer technique to merge the arrays from the end to the beginning. (avoids the inefficiency of shifting elements when merging from the start)

initiliaze i starting at the last valid element of nums1 (index m-1).

j starting at the last element of nums2 (index n-1).

k starting at the end of the merged array (index m+n-1).

compare elements from nums1 (starting from the end) and nums2 (starting from the end).

place the larger element at the position pointed to by k, then decrement the respective pointer (i or j) and k.

if there are remaining elements in nums2 after merging, copy them into the remaining positions in nums1.


# Code 

```
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    i = m - 1
    j = n - 1
    k = m + n - 1
    
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            nums1[k] = nums1[i]
            i -= 1
        else:
            nums1[k] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
        k -= 1
    
    while j >= 0:
        nums1[k] = nums2[j]
        j -= 1
        k -= 1
```
