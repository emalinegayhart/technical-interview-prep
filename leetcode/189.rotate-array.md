# Problem Description

```
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

```

# Approach

rotate the array, rotate first k indexes, then rotate everything after k indexes. 
make sure to "normalize" for k in case k is > the length of the array. use modulo to do this.

# Code 

```
def rotate(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    
    nums.reverse()
    
    nums[:k] = reversed(nums[:k])
    
    nums[k:] = reversed(nums[k:])
    
    return nums
```
