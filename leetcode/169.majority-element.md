# Problem Description

```
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
```

# notes to self:

 ⌊ and ⌋ symbols are floor brackets for floor division, meaning round to greatest integer less than or equal to result within the brackets

Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (works in o(n) time with o(1) complexity) - finds dominant element in a sequence of items (element appears more than half of the time). uses a counter to "vote" or "unvote" for each element if it is/is not the same as the last element, the dominant element will always win.

# Approach

initialize an element for majority element and a counter
iterate through the array of nums
if counter = 0, set the current element as the majority element
if the current element = the majority element, increment the counter
if not, decrement the counter
the value of majority element at the end of iterating is the majority element

# Code 

```
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        majority_element = None
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                majority_element = num
            count += (1 if num == majority_element else -1)
        
        return majority_element
