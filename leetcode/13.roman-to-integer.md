# Problem

[Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

# Problem Description

```
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
```

# Approach

- start from the right end of the string and compare each character with the next one. 
- if the current character has a smaller value than the next character, subtract the current value from the total (because we are dealing with cases like IV or IX).
- otherwise, just add the value of the current character to the total.
- use a dictionary to map Roman numerals to their corresponding values.

# Code

```
def romanToInt(s):
    roman_values = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if roman_values[s[i]] < roman_values[s[i + 1]]:
            total -= roman_values[s[i]]
        else:
            total += roman_values[s[i]]
    total += roman_values[s[-1]]
    return total
```

### Explanation:

- time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. we loop through the string once.
- space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space for the dictionary and a few variables.
