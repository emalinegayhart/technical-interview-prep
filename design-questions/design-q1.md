How would you design autocomplete for a search engine?

If I were to design autocomplete for a search engine, I’d start by thinking about the user experience first. The main goal of autocomplete is to help users type less and find what they’re looking for faster, so speed and relevance are really important.

From a high level, I’d break it down into a few key components:

Data Collection:
First, we need a large dataset of search queries. This could come from historical user search logs. We'd also want to clean this data—remove duplicates, spam, or anything inappropriate.

Ranking Suggestions:
Once we have the queries, we’d need a way to rank them. A simple approach is to use frequency—how often a query is searched. But to make it better, we could also consider recency (new trends), personalization (based on the user’s history), and context (like location or device).

Prefix Matching:
To generate suggestions as the user types, we could use a trie data structure. Tries are super efficient for prefix lookups and can give suggestions in real-time, which is crucial for user experience.

Filtering and Logic:
We’d need filters to avoid showing offensive or unsafe suggestions. Also, we might add logic to complete partial words, fix typos, or even support multiple languages.

Evaluation:
Finally, to evaluate how well our autocomplete is performing, I’d track metrics like click-through rate (CTR) on suggestions, time to complete a search, and maybe even abandonment rate.

If we had more resources, we could take it further by using machine learning models like language models or sequence-to-sequence models to generate smarter suggestions. But I’d definitely start with something rule-based and lightweight to prove out the design and improve from there
