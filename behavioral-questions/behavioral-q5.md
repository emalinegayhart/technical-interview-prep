Describe for me how you monitor your performance on the job.

One way I consistently monitor my performance is by setting clear, measurable goals at the start of any project or sprint. For example, during my internship at Shopify, I would begin each task by clarifying the expected outcomes with my team—whether it was evaluation metrics, deadlines, or code quality standards. Throughout the project, I tracked my progress using a combination of daily check-ins, personal to-do lists, and version control activity to ensure I was moving in the right direction.

In one instance, I was working on an MMR-based diversifier and had to frequently re-evaluate my implementation as the surrounding system evolved. I kept logs of each test run and compared them against expected outcomes and past benchmarks, which helped me spot issues early.

I also regularly sought feedback from peers and senior engineers—not just at the end, but at key milestones. This helped me stay aligned with team standards and adapt quickly if expectations shifted.

Overall, I view performance monitoring as an ongoing process of setting expectations, tracking progress with data, and staying open to feedback to continuously improve
