Describe how you tracked the progress of a project in relation to its deadline:

The team I was interning on at Shopify was tasked with creating LLM models that would help increase the relevance of 
search results for our Shop App. As an intern, I first was assigned Exploratory Data Analysis tasks, but wanted to push 
myself and created a proposal for a post processing step using the MMR algorithm as a base. I spoke with a staff engineer
 on how I assumed I would go about this and he gave suggestions to make the process easier. There were 4 main parts of this task.
  1) Implementing the algorithm in the ranking step as a post processing step 
  2) Conducting data analysis to showcase the differences between this diversifier, another, and the ranker without any diversifier 
  3) Create a script which allows me to collect mass amount of data of the diversifier using multiple parameters so that I can find the ideal parameters and 
  update the data with the data from the ideal parameters. 
  4) Compile findings and make a conclusion or case as to whether we should incorporate my MMR diversifier. 
  
  Since I broke the project down into 4 easily understandable parts, I was able to create a draft timeline with the staff engineer 
  to approximate what sort of timeline would be appropriate for a fulltime engineer and then add some leniency given that I am an part time intern. 
  I strove to push past intern expectations with the knowledge of how long it might take a full time engineer, but I also gave myself grace if I couldn't. 
  I was able to finish the MMR diversifier right after they finished shipping the new ranker and the other main diversifier which was on the critical path, 
  so the timing was perfect because we were able to get results for the one and then implement mine right after.
