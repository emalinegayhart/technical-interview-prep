Describe how you tracked the progress of a project in relation to its deadline:

Situation:
During my internship at Shopify, I was on a team tasked with improving the relevance of search results for the Shop App using LLM models. Initially, I was responsible for Exploratory Data Analysis, but I wanted to take on a more impactful contribution.

Task:
I proposed and took ownership of a new project: implementing a post-processing step using the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to improve search result diversity. The goal was to evaluate its effectiveness and determine if it should be integrated into our pipeline.

Action:
I broke the project into four key phases:

Implementing the MMR algorithm as a post-processing step in the ranking flow.

Conducting comparative data analysis between the MMR diversifier, an existing diversifier, and the ranker alone.

Developing a script to run large-scale experiments across various parameter combinations, allowing me to identify optimal configurations.

Compiling the results into a report with a recommendation on whether to adopt the MMR diversifier.

To stay on track, I worked with a staff engineer to build a realistic timeline based on what would be expected of a full-time engineer, with added flexibility since I was a part-time intern. I used this as a guide to pace myself, aiming to exceed expectations while being mindful of learning curves.

Result:
I completed the MMR implementation just after the team finished shipping the new ranker and another key diversifier that was on the critical path. The timing worked out perfectly, as we were able to test and evaluate my diversifier immediately afterward. This alignment ensured that my work contributed meaningfully to the broader project goals.
