What factors are the most important to you when you evaluate a job opportunity?

Situation:
When I was exploring internship opportunities last year, I had several offers on the table, and I had to be thoughtful about which one to accept. I wanted to make sure I chose a role that aligned with my values and career goals, not just one that looked good on paper.

Task:
My goal was to evaluate each opportunity based on what would help me grow both technically and professionally, while also ensuring the environment was a good personal fit.

Action:
I created a short list of criteria that were most important to me. First, I looked at the team culture—specifically whether there was a collaborative environment and mentorship available. Second, I prioritized learning opportunities—whether the role would allow me to stretch my technical skills and take ownership of meaningful projects. Third, I considered how aligned the company was with innovation and how fast they iterated—since I thrive in environments that move quickly and value experimentation. Lastly, I paid close attention to how people talked about their work during the interview process. That gave me insight into whether the team was motivated, supportive, and excited about what they were building.

Result:
Using these criteria, I chose an internship at Shopify, where I ended up contributing to production ML systems, learning from experienced engineers, and navigating real-world engineering challenges. That experience confirmed that these are the right factors for me, and they continue to guide how I evaluate future opportunities.
